## About
This app was built with SST (https://sst.dev), a severless application development platform for AWS. I followed the guide on their website to build a note taking app that utilizes various AWS services, including Lambda functions, DynamoDB, S3, API Gateway, and Cognito. Additionally, it has Stripe integration to allow users to purchase storage for their notes. It certainly isn’t pretty, but that’s because I really wanted to focus on understanding the technical aspect of AWS. Although the guide feels a bit dated in some parts, I had no problem following it and would recommend others who are interested in dipping their toes into the very complicated world of AWS start with this guide, it has been a tremendous help in understanding AWS services from a developer’s perspective.
